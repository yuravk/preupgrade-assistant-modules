 * For the "install" invocation, the "--preserve_context" option has been removed. The "--preserve-context" option can be used instead.

 * For the "stat" invocation, the "--context" option and its short form "-Z" have been removed. The SELinux context is now a part of the stat default output format.
 * For the "mkdir", "mknod", "mkfifo", "cp", and "install" invocations, the "-Z" option no longer accepts any arguments, and it automatically sets the default SELinux setting context. To set a specific context, the "--context=[context]" option has to be used.

+GRUB is used as a loader of the Linux system. However, CentOS 7 does not include GRUB anymore. Instead, it includes GRUB 2 only. Because the configuration system has been completely overhauled, it is not possible to migrate the GRUB setup to GRUB 2 automatically.
 During the upgrade process, GRUB will be preserved in the Master Boot Record, and a temporary GRUB configuration will be deployed, so that you can boot into the upgraded system.
 Because it is not possible to support the temporary configuration, you need to rewrite it, and install GRUB 2 to the Master Boot Record manually after the upgrade.
 For details about GRUB 2, see the "System Administrator's Guide" at [link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/System_Administrators_Guide/ch-Working_with_the_GRUB_2_Boot_Loader.html].

You can still use your current init scripts on the target system as they are internally wrapped and executed by systemd. However, in case you want to migrate your init scripts to unit files thoroughly, you have to do that manually. See [link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/912263] for more information.
